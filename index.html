<h2 align="left">Current Progress</h2>
<p>
So far, we have implemented the basic physics of fluid particles (position, velocity, and acceleration) with Euler integration, and we have also added collisions between particles. In each time step, we update the velocity of each particle to be v = v + TIMESTEP * a, and the position to be x = x + TIMESTEP * v. We also adapted the code from our cloth simulation project for collisions between particles by readjusting the positions of particles if they get too close to each other. We have modeled our update code after the algorithm from Macklin and Muller's "Position Based Fluids":

<p>Essentially, we have implemented lines 1-4 and line 14 of the algorithm above. We can currently simulate particles falling onto a surface, colliding with each other, and then spreading out. </p>

<h2 align="left">Our Plan</h2>
<p>
Relative to the schedule we had layed out in our proposal, we have currently achieved the goal we had set for where we wanted to be 1 week into the project. This means that we are about 1 week behind schedule, so we need to speed up our progress. It also means that we are likely not going to be able to achieve our reach goals. By the end of this week we need to have implemented the full algorithm and reserve time to run simulations.
